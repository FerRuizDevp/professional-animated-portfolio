##  Professional Animated Portfolio ‚Äî Full Description

This project is a dynamic, professional portfolio built with React and Vite to showcase my development projects and skills with a strong focus on performance, animations, and real-world functionality.

I developed a custom Node.js and Express backend to dynamically fetch project metadata from my GitHub repositories, allowing for automatic project updates without manually editing the frontend.

For the contact functionality, I integrated EmailJS to handle real-time email sending directly from the portfolio, styled and animated to match the overall design system.

Media assets (images and videos) were carefully managed for optimized loading and deployment. 

Both the frontend and backend were deployed on Render, ensuring a smooth, production-ready deployment pipeline.

This project involved setting up GitHub workflows, environment variables, a custom backend API, media folder management, and deploying a full-stack project ‚Äî all while keeping performance, SEO, and user experience in mind.

Quick tech highlights:
* React + Vite for frontend
* Node.js + Express for backend
* EmailJS for real-time email handling
* GitHub API Integration (dynamic project fetching)
* Full deployment on Render (frontend and backend)
* Optimized and animated UI/UX
* Media asset management

Special focus was placed on:
* Dynamic project loading with caching via localStorage
* Animated transitions for a polished user experience
* Custom GitHub API integration (fetching README-based metadata)
* Backend and frontend coordination with environment variables
* Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
* Media asset management to optimize loading speeds
* Deployment optimization (build processes, GitHub pushes, Render config)

This project involved not only designing and coding from scratch but also learning real-world deployment workflows, API management, error handling, build optimization, and service configuration ‚Äî resulting in a production-ready, professional web presence.
