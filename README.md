## Professional Animated Portfolio

This project is a fully custom-built, professional-grade animated portfolio designed to showcase my work as a web developer and designer. Built with React and Vite for a fast and modern frontend experience, the portfolio features smooth animations, dynamic project fetching from GitHub, and a backend integration for enhanced functionality.

The backend was developed using Node.js and Express, securely handling API requests and project metadata. The full project was deployed separately using Render for both the frontend and backend, ensuring optimized performance and scalability.

Special focus was placed on:
* Dynamic project loading with caching via localStorage
* Animated transitions for a polished user experience
* Custom GitHub API integration (fetching README-based metadata)
* Backend and frontend coordination with environment variables
* Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
* Media asset management to optimize loading speeds
* Deployment optimization (build processes, GitHub pushes, Render config)

This project involved not only designing and coding from scratch but also learning real-world deployment workflows, API management, error handling, build optimization, and service configuration ‚Äî resulting in a production-ready, professional web presence.
